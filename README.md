Method in [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/) created to distribute and find managers (Customer Success) who have more customers in their wallet.
The distribution is made among the available managers, crossing their scores with the customers' scores. Customers can be served by managers with scores equal to, greater than, or close to their own scores.

The idea of ​​uploading a repository came after I was finished, so not many semantic commits this time. :disappointed_relieved:
But you can learn more about [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/#summary)!

### :rocket: Quickstart <span id='quickstart'></span>
